                <h4>Iberian Peninsula CO2 Emission StoryMap</h4>
                <p>
                    This ArcGIS Online StoryMap analyzes carbon dioxide atmospheric concentrations in the Iberian Peninsula from 2021 to 2023
                    through multivariate mapping and an organized cartographic workflow.
                    It discusses the relationship between CO2 emissions and average annual temperatures,
                    along with influencing factors such as government spending on climate initiatives and the Covid-19 pandemic.
                    This project was completed as part of the curriculum for the Advanced GIS Certification graduate-level program
                    offered by the University of Wisconsin-Madison

                <h4>Coffee Tour of Eau Claire, WI StoryMap</h4>
                <p>
                    This ArcGIS Online StoryMap offers a guided tour of notable coffee shops and cafes in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
                    The project demonstrates the principles of visual cognition and spatiotemporal representation.
                    The StoryMap introduces a variety of local coffeehouses and other cultural hubs of this Wisconsin community.
                    The tour highlights the city's unique charm while providing optimal walking and biking routes between stops.
                    This project was completed as part of the curriculum for the Advanced GIS Certification graduate-level program
                    offered by the University of Wisconsin-Madison

                <h4>Politcal and Geographic Topography of Africa</h4>
                <p>
                    This map layout displays the political and geographic topography of the African continent in 2023.
                    The political boundaries of this map ranges from the country level down to the town level.
                    Geographic features such as mountain ranges, deserts, and rivers are also labeled to provide a comprehensive
                    depiction of the continent from a macro scale. The primary focus of this project was managing complex and
                    dense label placements while adhering to cartographic generalization principles to ensure clarity and
                    readability of the map. This project was completed as part of the curriculum for the
                    Advanced GIS Certification graduate-level program offered by the University of Wisconsin-Madison

                <h4>Environmental and Archaeological Analysis Moundville, AL</h4>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on the analysis of LIDAR data collected in 2021 from the Moundville, AL
                    National Historical Landmark. A digital elevation model (DEM) and hillshade raster files were created
                    from the LIDAR data to examine topographic changes, including erosional damage to mound structures and
                    potential undiscovered anthropogenic deposits. The analysis of the environmental spatial data revealed
                    that the expanding southern boundary of the Hemphill River Bend drainage basin is causing significant
                    erosional decay, affecting several mound structures. The delineated areas of erosion were mapped with
                    polyline feature classes to highlight the ongoing erosional damage and deflation of the mounds.
                    
                    These results provided an updated understanding of the site's topography and were used by the University
                    of Alabama to secure grant funding from the US Army Corp of Engineers to begin efforts to mitigate the
                    erosional damage in 2022.
